# Task Priority Manager

## Overview
The Task Priority Manager is a beginner-friendly JavaScript program that organizes a task by storing its name and estimated time, assigning priority (Low, Medium, High) using functions and conditionals, and displaying a formatted plan. Created as part of my Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course, it showcases fundamental JavaScript skills for my journey to become a full-stack developer.

## Features
- Stores task details (name, time) in an object using variables.
- Assigns task priority based on time using a function with conditionals.
- Validates time input with `typeof` and logical operators in a function expression.
- Performs calculations (e.g., extended time) using an arrow function with a default parameter.
- Rounds results with the `Math` object.
- Displays the plan with template literals, string concatenation, and string methods like `toUpperCase()`.
- Handles `undefined` data for missing tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core language for logic and output.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment to run the program.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Prerequisites**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer.
2. **Clone the Repository**:
